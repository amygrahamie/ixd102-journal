Week One
--------
>##[Point] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/136091978@N04/albums/72157659773749249/ "Point"). 
>*Task: 1 Point, 2 Points, 3 Points, 5 Points & 50 Points. Then we had to be creative and design a series of desktop backgrounds using point.*

Week Two
--------
>##[Line] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/136091978@N04/albums/72157657867739623/ "Line").
>*Task: 1 Line, 2 Lines, 3 Lines, 5 Lines & 50 Lines. Then similarly to week one we had to create a series of desktop backgrounds using lines.*

Week Three
--------
>##[Plane] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/136091978@N04/albums/72157657867739623/ "Plane").
>*Task: 1 Plane, 2 Planes and 9 Planes. Then finally we had create a series of desktop backgrounds using plane so I continued on from my designs from week 2*

>*The final exercise for this week was to create a modular typeface built from planes. Fontstruct is an excellent tool to help you do this but tricky sticking to their shapes and grid layout. Alternatively I found it useful to experiment with Sketch and Illustrator.*

Project 01

>>##[Type Poster] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/136091978@N04/albums/72157660198978605/ "Type Poster").

Week Four
---------
>##*Type* 
>We had to use 1 'M' in 20  different ways, we then had to choose two letters and join them in six ways and then complete a kerning exercise. 
>In addition to these, this weeks task was to create a [Movie Poster] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/136091978@N04/22428232071/in/album-72157660774112895/ "Movie Poster") in the style of Josef Müller Brockmann. 

Week Five
---------
>##*Colour*
Taking one of our previous projects we had revisit it using colour. Considering how complimentary, analagous or primary/secondary colours affect the design.


Week Seven-Twelve Screen
------------------------
>###Using the story of John Baskerville as a starting point the screen-based exercises will ground us with a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3, the building blocks of web-based content.

>####Week Six
*Taking the raw John Baskerville text as our starting point we ceated a simple [HTML5 page] (https://amygrahamie.github.io/John-Baskerville/version1.html) on our GitHub page.*
